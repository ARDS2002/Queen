                <p>The violin is the soprano of the string family. It has a hollow, wooden body and four strings. The
                    sound
                    made by
                    the violin can vary from bright and vibrant to solemn and mellow. The sound is made by drawing a bow
                    across the
                    strings, or by plucking the strings with a finger.</p>
                <p>The violin, colloquially known as a fiddle, is a wooden chordophone, and is the smallest, and thus
                    highest-pitched instrument (soprano) in regular use in the violin family. Smaller violin-type
                    instruments exist, including the violino piccolo and the pochette, but these are virtually unused.
                    Most violins have a hollow wooden body, and commonly have four strings (sometimes five), usually
                    tuned in perfect fifths with notes G3, D4, A4, E5, and are most commonly played by drawing a bow
                    across the strings. The violin can also be played by plucking the strings with the fingers
                    (pizzicato) and, in specialized cases, by striking the strings with the wooden side of the bow (col
                    legno).</p>
                <p>Violins are important instruments in a wide variety of musical genres. They are most prominent in the
                    Western classical tradition, both in ensembles (from chamber music to orchestras) and as solo
                    instruments. Violins are also important in many varieties of folk music, including country music,
                    bluegrass music, and in jazz. Electric violins with solid bodies and piezoelectric pickups are used
                    in some forms of rock music and jazz fusion, with the pickups plugged into instrument amplifiers and
                    speakers to produce sound. The violin has come to be incorporated in many non-Western music
                    cultures, including Indian music and Iranian music. The name fiddle is often used regardless of the
                    type of music played on it.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The violin first appeared in the Brescia area of Northern Italy in the early sixteenth
                        century.</li>
                    <li> From around 1485, Brescia was home to a school of highly prized string players and famous for
                        makers of
                        all the string instruments of the Renaissance; the viola da gamba, violone, lyra, lyrone,
                        violetta and
                        viola da brazzo.</li>
                    <li>The earliest evidence for their existence is in paintings by Gaudenzio Ferrari from the 1530s,
                        though Ferrari's
                        instruments
                        had only three strings.</li>
                    <li>The Acad√©mie musicale, a treatise written in 1556 by Philibert Jambe de Fer,
                        gives a clear description of the violin family much as we know it today.</li>

                    <li>Violins are likely to have been developed from a number of other string instruments of the 15th
                        and
                        16th
                        centuries, including the vielle, rebec, and lira da braccio. The history of bowed string
                        instruments
                        in
                        Europe goes back to the 9th century with the Byzantine lira (or l≈´rƒÅ, Greek: ŒªœçœÅŒ±).</li>

                    <li>Since their invention, instruments in the violin family have seen a number of changes. The
                        overall
                        pattern for the instrument was set in the 17th century by luthiers like the prolific Amati
                        family,
                        Jakob
                        Stainer of the Tyrol, and Antonio Stradivari, with many makers at the time and since following
                        their
                        templates.</li>

                    <Strong>A favourite among soloists, Tchaikovsky‚Äôs only violin concerto was composed in 1878,
                        following the breakdown of his marriage the year prior. Despite not being a violinist himself,
                        the Russian composer wrote the 35-minute work in just one month, aided by Yosif Kotek, a young
                        virtuoso of the instrument. Scholars muse Kotek was perhaps also at one time a lover of the
                        19th-century composer. Tchaikovsky reportedly wanted to dedicate the concerto to the young male
                        violinist, but worried about this act inciting gossip. Filled with romantic melodies, and tender
                        lyricism, the concerto can‚Äôt help but reveal some of the feelings perhaps felt by the composer
                        during its composition.</Strong>

                                Jewish-Russian-American violinist, widely regarded as one of the greatest violinists of
                                all time.
                                Born in Vilnius, he was soon recognized as a child prodigy and was trained in the
                                Russian classical
                                violin style in St. Petersburg. Accompanying his parents to escape the violence of the
                                Russian
                                Revolution, he moved to the United States as a teenager, where his Carnegie Hall debut
                                was
                                rapturously received. Fritz Kreisler, another leading violinist of the twentieth

                                hearing Heifetz's debut, "We might as well take our fiddles and break them across our

                                Perlman was born in 1945 in Tel Aviv. His parents, Chaim and Shoshana Perlman, were
                                Jewish natives of Poland and had independently emigrated to Mandatory Palestine in the
                                mid-1930s before they met and later married. Perlman contracted polio at age four and
                                has walked using leg braces and crutches since then and plays the violin while
                                seated. As of 2018, he uses crutches or an electric scooter for mobility.
                                When Perlman was three years old, he sat and listened attentively to a violin recital on
                                the radio, which inspired him to become a violinist. His mother soon bought him a toy
                                violin, and he instantly taught himself to play melodies. His parents tried to enroll
                                him at the Shulamit Conservatory, but he was denied admission for being too small to
                                hold a violin.Despite his handicap, he began learning the violin a year later. His
                                first teacher was a caf√© violinist. At age five, Perlman was admitted to the Academy of
                                Music in Tel Aviv (now the Buchmann-Mehta School of Music), where he studied for eight
                                years with Rivka Goldgart, a violin teacher of Russian origin, and gave his first
                                recital at age ten.He moved to the United States at age 13 to study at the
                                Juilliard School and Meadowmount School of Music with the violin teacher Ivan
                                Galamian and his assistant Dorothy DeLay.

                                five with Galina Turchaninova.Upon meeting him, she asked: "Do you have strength
                                in these hands?" The five-year-old punched her in the stomach as hard as he could.
                                He said years later: "Fortunately, she was in a good mood that day, and she accepted me
                                as a student."
                                Lessons went badly at first.Turchaninova was very strict.At one point,

                                upon seeing that, Vengerov picked up his violin and played 17 assigned pieces from
                                memory without interruption.Even though he had refused to play at his lessons,
                                he had been practicing.Turchaninova agreed to continue his lessons, saying: "Very
                                well. A violinist like Maxim is born only once in a hundred years."
